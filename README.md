# React Portfolio

## Description
  
While searching for a job in web development, it is important to have a portfolio of all my work that can be easily viewed by potential employers. To show off what I have accomplished as well as build skills in React, I have created a simple single-page react application that I will develop and use to show off what I have learned. I learned more about building websites with CSS and along with using the tailwinds framework and basic React functionality.
